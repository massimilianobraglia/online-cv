                Team and tech leader of a cross-functional international team composed of 4 developers and a product owner.
                
                Together with the software architect, I evaluated and proposed technical solutions to the tech management in order to 
                implement and adopt the best practices of software engineering. Teamed up with engineering managers and team leaders of other teams, 
                I defined the corporate technical direction.
                
                The Scrum framework was adopted trying to follow all the principles and guidelines in the best possible way and 
                in close contact with the product team we described in user stories and implemented new features requested by the company stakeholders.
                We used Story Points as a measure of estimation for our cards.
                
                I have provided constant support to the developers both in pair programming and in code review in order to always 
                try to get the best result at the cost of the right effort. I held regular 1-to-1 meetings so that I could always 
                get feedback and to understand how best to motivate team members, up to the definition of their growth goals in their career.
